## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use CSS flexbox to wrap elements in a column and center them with the
'justify-content' and the 'align-items' properties.


```css
body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to develop more with html form tags and css grid system and layouts. Javascript as well so
I can build more functional websites.
